# The Penny Method

## What This Is

The Penny Method is an awesome way of practicing all sorts of things.
First, you start out with 5 pennies, and everytime you complete something,
such as a speedrun trick or basketball free-throw, you move one of the pennies
to the side (instead this adds a checkmark). But, if you miss a trick or shot, then
you have to reset and move all the pennies back over and start doing it again.

## Why I Made It

I made this project because I've used this method for practicing speedrun tricks for
a while, and I want to share it with everyone, too.
